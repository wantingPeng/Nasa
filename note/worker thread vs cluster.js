/* 2. Use Cases

    Cluster Module:
        Ideal for scaling I/O-bound applications like web servers, APIs, or real-time applications.
        Useful when you want to leverage multi-core CPUs to handle multiple incoming network requests concurrently.

    Example Use Cases:
        Web server handling a large number of concurrent HTTP requests.
        RESTful API server with many clients making simultaneous requests.

    Worker Threads Module:
        Best suited for CPU-bound tasks where you need parallel execution within the same process.
        Ideal for handling heavy computations that would otherwise block the event loop, such as data processing, image manipulation, video encoding, or machine learning tasks.

    Example Use Cases:
        Performing complex mathematical calculations.
        Image processing, resizing, or rendering.
        Large data transformations or parsing.
3. Communication and Data Sharing

    Cluster Module:
        Communication between the master and worker processes happens via Inter-Process Communication (IPC).
        Messages are passed between processes using process.send() and the message event, but this requires serialization and deserialization, which adds overhead.
        Each worker process has its own separate memory space, meaning there is no direct data sharing.

    Worker Threads Module:
        Communication between threads is achieved via message passing using parentPort.postMessage() and the message event, similar to clusters.
        Unlike cluster, threads can also share memory using SharedArrayBuffer and Atomics, allowing efficient data sharing between threads.

4. Memory and Resource Usage

    Cluster Module:
        Each worker process has its own memory and V8 instance, leading to higher memory consumption.
        More resource-intensive but provides process-level isolation, which enhances fault tolerance.

    Worker Threads Module:
        Threads share the same memory space, making them more memory-efficient compared to processes.
        Threads are lightweight and consume fewer resources, making them suitable for scenarios where multiple parallel tasks need to be executed without the overhead of full processes.

/* Key Features of Worker Threads

    Each worker thread has its own V8 instance (JavaScript engine) and event loop, allowing it to execute JavaScript code in parallel with other threads.
    Worker threads can communicate with the main thread (or other workers) using a mechanism called message passing.
    The main thread remains responsive and continues to handle I/O-bound operations while the worker threads perform CPU-intensive tasks in the background. */
